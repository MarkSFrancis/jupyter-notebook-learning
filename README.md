# Jupyter Notebook Learning
This repository tracks my learning how to use and get started with Jupyter Notebook. 

# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an application designed for data scientists to give them an interactive development experience, somewhere between a REPL and a full blown IDE.  

You can find out more about Jupyter Notebook from [their website](https://jupyter.org/), or from [their GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).

## Installation

You can install Jupyter directly from [their website](https://jupyter.org/), or from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). Anaconda contains a collection of data scientist tools and python, as well as the jupyter notebook platform. Anaconda is also [open source](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/anaconda-project).
